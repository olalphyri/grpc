The unaired pilot has some differences from the aired version, such as a different actor playing the villain, a different location for the final confrontation, and a different tone and style.

What are the main differences between the unaired pilot and the aired version of "A Study in Pink"? Here are some of the most noticeable ones:
  
- The unaired pilot is 60 minutes long, while the aired version is 90 minutes long. This means that some scenes are shortened, cut, or added in the aired version, such as the police press conference, the taxi chase, and the confrontation with Moriarty.
- The unaired pilot has a different actor playing the villain, Jeff Hope. He is portrayed by Michael McElhatton in the unaired pilot, and by Phil Davis in the aired version. The character also has a different motive and method for killing his victims in the unaired pilot.
- The unaired pilot does not feature Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother and a powerful government official. He is played by Mark Gatiss, who also co-created and co-wrote the series. In the unaired pilot, Sherlock only emails him at the end of the episode.
- The unaired pilot does not have the on-screen text messages and deductions that became a signature feature of the series. These graphics help to show how Sherlock thinks and communicates in a modern and engaging way.
- The unaired pilot has a different actress playing Sally Donovan, a police officer who distrusts and dislikes Sherlock. She is played by Zawe Ashton in the unaired pilot, and by Vinette Robinson in the aired version.
- The unaired pilot has a different location for the final confrontation between Sherlock and Jeff Hope. In the unaired pilot, it takes place in an abandoned building, while in the aired version, it takes place in a school.
- The unaired pilot has a different tone and style than the aired version. The unaired pilot is darker, grittier, and more realistic, while the aired version is more colorful, stylized, and humorous.

These are some of the major changes that were made to improve and refine Sherlock's first episode. The unaired pilot is still an interesting and enjoyable watch for fans of the series, but it is clear that the aired version is superior in many ways.
