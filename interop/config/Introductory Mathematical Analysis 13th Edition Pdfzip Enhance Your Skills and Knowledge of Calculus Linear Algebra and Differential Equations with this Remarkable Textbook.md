Mathematical analysis is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behavior of functions, limits, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, and other mathematical objects. Mathematical analysis is also known as real analysis or classical analysis, and it is closely related to other fields such as complex analysis, functional analysis, numerical analysis, and harmonic analysis.
 
Mathematical analysis has many applications in various disciplines of science, engineering, and technology. For example, mathematical analysis can be used to model physical phenomena such as heat, sound, waves, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity. Mathematical analysis can also be used to solve optimization problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum of a function subject to some constraints. Mathematical analysis can also be used to develop numerical methods, such as interpolation, approximation, integration, differentiation, and solving differential equations.
 
Mathematical analysis is a rich and diverse field that offers many challenges and opportunities for research and discovery. The Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes original papers that treat mathematical analysis and its numerous applications[^1^]. The journal covers topics such as calculus of variations, differential equations, functional analysis, integral equations, nonlinear analysis, operator theory, optimization theory, and more. The journal also welcomes papers that explore the connections between mathematical analysis and other areas of mathematics or science.
