# How to Reset Waste Ink Pad Counter of Epson Stylus SX218 Printer
 
If you own an Epson Stylus SX218 printer, you may encounter a problem where the printer stops working and displays an error message like "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life. Please contact Epson Support." This means that the waste ink pad counter has reached its limit and needs to be reset.
 
The waste ink pad counter is a feature that keeps track of how much ink is used for cleaning the print head and other maintenance tasks. When the counter reaches a certain value, the printer stops working to prevent ink from overflowing and damaging the printer or the environment.
